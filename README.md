# New Chapter
Now I'm gonna do a bunch of edits to this file so I can add a few more commits to the new branch named 'Dev' 

# Second Chapter
Now I'm gonna add even more changes on this main branch that would probably result in a merge conflict when I try to merge the two branches, but I'm giving them separate histories anyways.

# Third Chapter
I keep doing commits on this branch so it would be pretty interesting to solve this yarn of commits.

# Fourth Chapter
Now we have four chapters in total.

# Fifth Chapter
So I manage to merge the two branches manually and then delete the dev branch.
